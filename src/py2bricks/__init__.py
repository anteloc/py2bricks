"""
py2bricks — A Python-embedded DSL for generating LEGO LDraw models.

An LLM generates Python scripts using this library's primitives (box, wall,
floor_slab, column, group, place, attach, gable_roof) and the library
handles all geometric correctness, brick tiling, and LDraw export.

Architecture:
  - Everything uses stud units (X, Z) and plate units (Y) internally.
  - LDraw coordinate conversion happens only at export time.
  - Walls store a boolean grid; brick tiling is computed at export.
  - Each class has a to_placements() method returning BrickPlacement lists.
  - Scene collects all placements and writes a single .mpd file.

Package structure:
  coords.py     — Coordinate constants, conversion, rotation matrices
  parts.py      — PartType enum, Part catalog, Color constants
  core.py       — BuilderError, BrickPlacement
  wall.py       — Wall class (grid, openings, tiling)
  structures.py — Box, FloorSlab, Column
  roof.py       — GableRoof, _tile_row helper
  assembly.py   — Group, place(), attach(), Element type
  scene.py      — Scene (top-level container + LDraw export)
