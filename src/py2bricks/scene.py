Scene: top-level container and LDraw exporter.

The Scene is the top-level container. It holds all elements and
exports the final LDraw .mpd file.

Usage:
  scene = Scene("my_building")
  box = scene.box(24, 16, 10)
  ...
  scene.export("output.mpd")

The Scene provides factory methods (scene.box(), scene.wall(), etc.)
so all elements are automatically tracked. Elements can also be
added manually with scene.add().
